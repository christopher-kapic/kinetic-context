# kinetic-context

**kinetic-context** is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that helps developers get information about open-source dependencies. It provides a Docker image that you can run locally, exposing an MCP server that AI coding tools can connect to for querying dependency information.

## What is kinetic-context?

kinetic-context allows you to:

- **Query dependencies** - Ask questions about how to use open-source packages
- **Manage projects** - Organize dependencies for different projects
- **Version control** - Use specific versions/tags of dependencies per project
- **AI-powered answers** - Uses OpenCode AI to provide intelligent answers about dependencies

The server clones repository code for dependencies and uses [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-dev/opencode) (an AI code editor) to answer questions about how to use dependencies.

## Quick Start

Get started with kinetic-context in minutes. See the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation) for detailed manual setup instructions (recommended), or use the automated script:

```bash
# Manual installation is recommended - see Installation guide
# Alternative: Automated script (use at your own risk)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christopher-kapic/kinetic-context/master/setup.sh)

# Authenticate to GitHub Container Registry (required for opencode image)
docker login ghcr.io

# Start kinetic-context
kctx start
```

Then access the web UI at [http://localhost:7167](http://localhost:7167)

## Features

- **MCP Server** - Model Context Protocol server for dependency queries
- **Web Interface** - Browser-based UI for managing projects and dependencies
- **Docker Support** - Easy deployment with Docker
- **Version Management** - Pin specific versions of dependencies per project
- **AI Integration** - Powered by OpenCode for intelligent code analysis

## How It Works

1. **Configure Packages** - Add package configurations to define which dependencies are available
2. **Create Projects** - Set up projects and associate them with specific dependencies
3. **Query Dependencies** - Use the MCP server or web UI to ask questions about dependencies
4. **Get Answers** - OpenCode analyzes the dependency code and provides intelligent answers

## Architecture

- **Server** - Hono-based API server with MCP endpoint
- **Web Frontend** - React application with TanStack Router
- **OpenCode Integration** - AI-powered code analysis
- **Docker** - Containerized deployment for easy setup
